___
* User can input the Parent node value and child note value as they want to use.
*  If that node already  in map then, user can terminate from creating new node.
* Otherhand if the node is not exists in the map then user can create one.
* Here is an Exception Handler what can handle cases:
     * [x] Already inputed Right child can not be input in the same place.
     * [x] Already inputed Left child can not  input in the same place.
